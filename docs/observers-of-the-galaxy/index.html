        <p>Although I wrote this song, my memories of the entire process are quite vague. Perhaps because shortly afterwards, I performed in front of a crowd for the very first time singing this song <!--more-->and that whole experience was so overpowering that the songwriting process was overshadowed next to it. I approached my piano teacher at the time who helped me with the piano accomponiment. I owe a lot to her. I ended up playing it at a concert my grade organised in high school. We performed a lot of different pieces, including another piece I had written that my choir teacher had wrote the arrangement for.</p>
<p>I was so nervous when I stepped up to the piano alone. I played it two nights in a row. I still remember messing up one of the parts on the second night, but this is not necessarily a bad memory for me. It made me realise that songwriting is something I really enjoy, while performing is nice, but generally unpleasant due to the anxiety and fear that comes along with it. In the end, I was just immensely proud of myself.</p>
<p>I was born in November, so that is what is being referred to when I mention ‘winter bones’. I think this song was meant to represent how I often felt like an outsider looking in, just constantly watching events unfold as a passive observer never taking any action myself. That was a big theme for me during my final years at high school. I didn’t really do much, just let myself be pulled and carried by the flow. I didn’t actively organise any events or meetups, I was asked (or more often than not, just heard about these events after the fact). But I was still hopeful that things would get better and I was certain I wasn’t alone in feeling lonely. I’m still sure of that to this day.</p>
<h2 id="lyrics">Lyrics</h2>
<p>We winter bones<br />
We live so long<br />
We see it all<br />
We know to hold.</p>
<p>And we are there<br />
We silent trees<br />
Eternally<br />
My ears and me.</p>
<p><em>Chorus:</em><br />
Quiet observers of the galaxy<br />
Sing with me.<br />
There must be more than that which eyes can see<br />
See with me.<br />
And though it all feels so far away<br />
I’m here to stay.<br />
My spaceship of glass<br />
All bottled up<br />
Build to last.</p>
<p>We’re build to last<br />
And they haven’t asked<br />
How hear the great?<br />
We know to wait.</p>
<p>And we are here<br />
We ancient souls<br />
My, hands, my fear.</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>We many man the manless crew<br />
We chosen choose the chosen few<br />
We are the ones who carry through.</p>
<p>Quiet observers of the galaxy<br />
Sing with me.<br />
There must be more than that which eyes can see<br />
See with me.</p>
