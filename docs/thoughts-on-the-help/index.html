        <p>I have read few books that have left me feeling as conflicted as I felt when I turned over the last page of The Help by Kathryn Stockett. <!--more--> I wasn’t, and still am not, entirely sure how I feel about this novel. Combined with the feeling of not knowing how I <em>should</em> even feel about it (although knowing I should not really be taking any heed of that), I cannot say that this was the easiest reading experience I have ever had. However, it made me think, and is that not exactly what a good book should aim to achieve?</p>
<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<p>The novel, published in 2009, is set in the early 1960s in Jackson, Mississippi, and follows certain events in the lives of three women living there. Aibileen Clark, the first character the reader is acquainted with, is an African American maid who works for the Leefolt family and dotes on Mae Mobley, their young daughter. Skeeter Phelan is a white woman whose father owns a cotton farm. Finally, Minny is Aibileen’s friend who works for Mrs. Walters, an old lady and the mother of Holly Holbrook, a friend of Skeeter’s. Minny has been criticised and fired many times for her tendency to be too truthful towards her employers.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of the novel, Skeeter, who dreams of becoming a writer, attempts to discover the truth behind what happened to her childhood maid, Constantine. She disappeared with no explanation while Skeeter was at college after having written to her saying she had a big surprise waiting for her for when she got back home. No one is willing to tell Skeeter what happened to Constantine.</p>
<p>Skeeter finds a job writing a cleaning advice column in a local newspaper, thinking this will be a good first step towards realising her dream. However, because she knows nothing about keeping a household, she asks Aibileen for advice and eventually forms a friendship with her. She offers Aibileen money after feeling like she is in a way taking advantage of her by benefitting from her expertise without giving or being able to give her any credit for it. Aibileen declines the money. After contacting a publisher, Skeeter decides to write a book detailing the lives of black maids in Jackson. She wants to conduct interviews with them and expose the truth of their maltreatment, but finds it hard to gain their trust. Eventually, Aibileen agrees to join the project and starts telling Skeeter about her life and various situations that have taken place while working as a maid. She also attempts to recruit other maids to tell their stories but it is extremely difficult to find maids willing to reveal so much due to their mistrust of white people or their unwillingness to reveal such personal details about themselves and their employers.</p>
<p>Minny eventually agrees to tell her story as well. Skeeter starts to research the Jim Crow laws and is found out by Hilly, who is the president of the Junior League and highly influential in their community. Although they are supposed to be best friends, Hilly shuns Skeeter once she discovers that Skeeter could be supporting the Civil Rights Movement. This results in Skeeter losing all social standing and being alienated from her social group.</p>
<p>Once the book – titled “Help” – is published, although Skeeter made sure to anonymise the location and the names in the book, it quickly becomes clear to the residents of Jackson that their stories are the ones being detailed within it. However, thanks to Minny describing one unsavoury incident that could reflect very badly on Hilly, Hilly desperately attempts to stifle all these conjectures. Not all the stories are so bad; some describe events of great kindness and generosity. However, it is telling that the actors in these positive events do not publicise their sympathies towards their black maids, knowing that the backlash from society would be extreme.</p>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>I read this novel for the book club I take part in. The first I ever heard of it was in a YouTube video that discussed the “white saviour” trope prevalent in many films, including – according to the author of this particular video – the one based on this book. As such, I may have been somewhat biased when I started reading. However, I was not the only one who struggled with facts surrounding this novel, as the main topic that was discussed during the book club session was the fact that this novel which was focused on black maids in the 60s was in actual fact authored by a white, middle-class woman whose family had employed a black maid themselves.</p>
<p>I should probably mention that I am far from an expert on this topic or this time in history. I did not grow up in the USA, so my knowledge and understanding of the historical context is very limited and I do not attempt to pretend that I know all of the facts necessary to present a comprehensive critique of this novel, nor the historical events surrounding it. However, I am only trying to detail how this book made me feel, and to sort out the thoughts it elicited in me. And I can say that while reading, I was often reminded of Arthur Golden’s “Memoirs of a Geisha”, a novel I thoroughly enjoyed for its beautiful writing, but cannot describe as anywhere close to being authentic. The same can be said for “The Help”.</p>
<p>Curiously, both authors were implicated in lawsuits after the supposed bases for the characters presented in their books – in Stockett’s case, her brother’s housekeeper, who accused her of stealing her life story; and in Golden’s, a geisha whose story he publicised with her name despite promising to keep it anonymous. Make of that what you will, but I find it an ironic twist of events that these two books that I find so similar were caught up in similar accusations too. Perhaps this can tell us something of what makes these stories so problematic – the authors are basing these tales not on something that they themselves experienced, but on lives they claim from a superior position. Authors can and should have the freedom to write about topics of their choosing, but it becomes a different matter altogether when they seem to take advantage of their position and misrepresent an entire group’s way of life in the name of equality or spiritualism, or whatever reason there may be.</p>
<p>It is therefore hard to overlook the fact that the character Skeeter seems to serve as a congratulatory self-insert of the author herself into the storyline, while at the same time drawing attention away from those who should be the main protagonists of this novel – black maids and <em>their</em> stories. This is further supported by the essay included in my edition of this novel, the reading of which left me with a bad taste in my mouth. There, Stockett describes her own childhood maid, Demetrie McLorn, who seems to possess many of the qualities that Aibileen is described as having as well.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the moments where Skeeter seemed to show some level of self-reflection, but these moments came too rarely. In the end, the novel came across as a form of virtue signalling and the author seemed to draw as much attention as possible to the good deeds of Skeeter and the other white women, while not really going into many details about many of the horrific acts that were perpetuated by some people at the time. Although these are described briefly, it did not quite have the level of brevity it should have. However, I enjoyed how Stockett was able to describe the intricacies of the social system at the time and I was fascinated by the dichotomy posed by the absolute trust that these families put into their maids – entrusting their children and their homes to them – and the simultaneous distrust and disparaging attitude that they held towards them. These almost seem like a contradiction, and yet it is astounding to me that it is the truth. It was an everyday occurence that was experienced and accepted by many people.</p>
<p>Another aspect that initially threw me off was the fact that, when writing from Aibileen and Minny’s perspectives, the chapters were written with a dialect. I got used to it, but found it interesting that the author only used these dialects when it was the black characters speaking or thinking, and not for any others, even if they had been described as having a dialect as well.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I am reading currently To Kill a Mockingbird and found it curious how the simple shift in focus can do away with the uneasy feeling I received when reading The Help. On the back cover of my edition, it is proclaimed that The Help “could be one of the most important pieces of fiction since <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>” and that “[i]f you read only one book…let this be it”. I wholeheartedly disagree, unless you want to read it to find out how this topic should not be dealt with.</p>

<li>The Association of Black Women Historians released <a href="http://abwh.org/2011/08/12/an-open-statement-to-the-fans-of-the-help/">An Open Statement to the Fans of The Help</a> which describes issues with the novel and the film far more eloquently and knowledgeably than I can.</li>
<li>Kimiko Akita’s essay on “Memoirs of a Geisha” is extremely interesting and discusses the idea of Orientalism in the context of Golden’s novel. I highly recommend anyone who has read Memoirs of a Geisha or seen the film to give it a read:
